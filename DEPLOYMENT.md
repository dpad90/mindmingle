4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Configure the app:
   - Select the repository and branch
   - Choose Node.js as the runtime
   - Set the build command to `cd backend && npm install`

   - Set the HTTP port to `3000`
6. Add any environment variables if needed
7. Click "Launch App"

## Deploying to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

1. Create an AWS account if you don't have one
2. Install the AWS CLI and EB CLI
3. Configure AWS CLI
   ```
   aws configure
   ```

   ```
   FROM node:14-alpine

   WORKDIR /app

   COPY package*.json ./
   COPY backend/package*.json ./backend/

   RUN cd backend && npm install

   COPY . .

## Considerations for Production

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - For example, set PORT environment variable to change the default port

2. **Security**
   - Set up HTTPS for secure communication
   - Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Add input validation on both client and server

3. **Scaling**
   - Consider using a service like Redis for session management if scaling horizontally
   - Implement a load balancer if deploying multiple instances

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up logging and monitoring
   - Consider services like New Relic, Datadog, or AWS CloudWatch

5. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment**
   - Set up automated testing
   - Configure CI/CD pipelines for automatic deployment
