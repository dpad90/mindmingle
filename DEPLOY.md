## Prerequisites

Before deployment, ensure you have:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git (for version control)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- A domain name (optional, but recommended for production)

## Local Testing

Before deploying, test your application locally:

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd omegle-clone/backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

Your application should be running at http://localhost:3001.

## Docker Deployment

The project includes a Dockerfile for containerized deployment:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t funky-chat .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3001:3001 funky-chat
```

## Cloud Platform Deployment

### Heroku

1. Create a Heroku account if you don't have one
2. Install the Heroku CLI
3. Log in to Heroku
   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```
4. Create a new Heroku app
   ```bash
   heroku create funky-chat
   ```
5. Set up the Procfile (already included)
6. Deploy to Heroku
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```
7. Open the app
   ```bash
   heroku open
   ```

### DigitalOcean App Platform

1. Create a DigitalOcean account
2. From the DigitalOcean dashboard, select "Apps" â†’ "Create App"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the app:
   - Select Node.js as the environment
   - Set the HTTP port to 3001
   - Configure environment variables if needed
5. Click "Launch App"

### Railway

1. Sign up for Railway at https://railway.app/
2. Create a new project
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Railway will automatically detect the Node.js project
5. Configure environment variables if needed
6. Deploy the project

### Render

1. Sign up for Render at https://render.com/
2. Create a new Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the service:
   - Select Node.js as the environment
   - Set the build command to `cd backend && npm install`
   - Set the start command to `cd backend && node server.js`
   - Set the HTTP port to 3001
5. Click "Create Web Service"

## Custom VPS Deployment

For more control, deploy to a Virtual Private Server (VPS):

1. Set up a VPS with Ubuntu or your preferred Linux distribution
2. Install Node.js and npm
3. Clone your repository
4. Install PM2 for process management
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   ```
5. Start your application with PM2
   ```bash
   pm2 start backend/server.js --name funky-chat
   ```
6. Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your-domain.com;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
   }
   ```
7. Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt

## Production Considerations

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for configuration:

```
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
# Add other environment variables as needed
```

### Security

1. Set up a firewall (UFW on Ubuntu)
2. Keep dependencies updated
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Consider adding CAPTCHA for new sessions
5. Set up automatic security updates

### Scaling

For handling more users:
1. Use load balancing
2. Scale horizontally with multiple instances
3. Add Redis for session management
4. Consider microservices architecture for specific features

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Set up logging with tools like Winston or Bunyan
2. Use monitoring services like New Relic, Datadog, or PM2's monitoring
3. Set up alerts for downtime or errors
4. Create regular backup procedures
5. Establish an update and maintenance schedule
